Nowdays the web develop become much more complex, we need to know node, npm, babel, webpack, React, Vue, and many router and state library to finish work.
but I think we can still keep simple, like jQuery. so I write some methods to simplify daily work. It's no other thing but some short name for native methods.
I think it's enough for most develop work.

### About the name

I think one charactor name is clear enough, 'iOS' is also just one charactor name, but I think it's more cute than a long name like 'Android', so I arrange all
charactor, and sort them to three groups.

i t e n g u o x

a f h k m p q s v

b c d j l r w y z

the first group is good, can be used for most environment. usually, 'i t e n' for local name, and 'g u o x' for global name.
the second group is so so, can be used some times.
the third group is not so good in appearance, so I don't use them often.

more concretely, 'g' means 'global', and it usually be the name of global object. and 'u' can be think as 'ultra' or 'ultimate', so I use as the global name.
't' often use like 'to' or 'transform', and e use like 'edit', 'n' use as 'find' or 'number', 'i' use as 'it', 'itself'.

the qcs, qht, qjs method is about some thoughts to simplify the css, html, and js code, inspired from the [gulp-qcss](https://github.com/zhangxinxu/gulp-qcss)

the code is simple, so you can use it as you like, add or change its name and method accoding to your habit.
